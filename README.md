#Data Encoding: 

This process converts categorical data, such as 'Male' or 'Female', into numerical values that machine learning models can understand. This is essential for model training and accuracy.

Feature Scaling: 

To ensure that features contribute equally to the model, feature scaling brings all numerical data within a specific range. This prevents features with larger values from dominating the model's decision-making process.

Handling Imbalance Data: 

When one class in a dataset significantly outweighs the other, it can lead to biased models. Techniques like oversampling or undersampling are used to balance the dataset, improving model performance and preventing overfitting.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): 

SVM is a classification algorithm that creates a decision boundary to separate data points into different classes. It focuses on finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between these classes, leading to better generalization.

Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning: 

To optimize model performance, grid search systematically evaluates different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best configuration. This helps in achieving the highest accuracy and robustness of the model.
